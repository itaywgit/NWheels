Use Cases
---------------------
UC1 - Assess system health daily, by manual examination of overall statistics
UC2 - Get alerted about critical errors and escalated conditions (+ability to de-escalate condition), in real time
UC3 - Analyze misbehaviors and performance issues
UC4 - Perform statistical analysis on messages and their parameters, in order to gain production intelligence insights, e.g. detect frauds

Functions
---------------------
FN1 - Query messages 
      FN1.1 Select messages within time range
      FN1.2 Filter messages by any combination of: machine, node/instance, level, logger, message id, duration, exception type, key value
      FN1.3 Display number of selected messages over time axis, in regular or logarithmic scale
      FN1.4 Display list of selected messages with expanding details pane
      FN1.5 In details pane, display list of message key-values, and other details e.g. exception
      FN1.6 For each key-value, display distribution statistics of most occurring values values: for each value, display percent of its occurrence among other values 
      FN1.7 Allow one-click navigation, which adds clicked element to query criteria: machine, node/instance, level, logger, message id, exception type, key value
      FN1.8 Navigate to drill down view of containing thread log (FN2), with the message initially selected in the drill-down view
      FN1.9 Allow selecting one or more message ids corresponding to activities, and display the following statistics per activity message id:
            (A) count - number of occurrences
            (B) avg. duration
            (C) max duration
            (D) min duration
            (E) % failures
            (F) avg. rate per 10 sec
            (G) mix rate per 10 sec
            (H) max rate per 10 sec
            in the following formats:
            (1) summary table
            (2) graph over time axis, in regular or logarithmic scale 
      FN1.10 Display index of displayed messages with navigation to selected messages within the view

FN2 - Query threads
      FN2.1 Select thread logs within time range
      FN2.2 Filter thread logs by any combination of: machine, node/instance, task type, duration, log level, log id, correlation id, message id
      FN2.3 Display number of selected thread logs over time axis, in regular or logarithmic scale
      FN2.4 Display list of selected thread logs
      FN2.5 Expand drill down view of a selected thread log
      FN2.6 Display message index of displayed thread logs with navigation to selected messages within the view
     
FN3 - Reports
      FN3.1 Define count query on messages and threads with filtering and grouping by any combination of criteria in FN1 and FN2, respectively, and format results as a table.
      FN3.2 Optionally store the query under a name defined by user ("named query")
      FN3.3 Run a query by user command
      FN3.4 Run a named query automatically by defined schedule
      FN3.5 Display query results online
      FN3.6 Send query results by email
      FN3.7 Define alert mode (named query result count > 0) and send alert email (FN3.6) when run on schedule (FN3.4).
      FN3.8 Define real-time alerts through short-interval schedule (FN3.4, FN3.6, FN3.7)
